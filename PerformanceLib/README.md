"# a10c-perf-lib" 

This is a work-in-progress library for DCS A-10C performance calculations.

## Takeoff Performance

- PTFS: Predicted Fan Speed
- Takeoff index (Max thrust and 3% below PTFS)
- Takeoff speed (Flaps 7 config only )
- Rotation speed ( Flaps 7 config only )
- Takeoff Ground run (distance)  with wind correction (Flaps 7)

- RCR values and conversion without antiskid

## Utils

- QNH Conversions
- PressureAltitude calculation
