"# a10c-perf-lib" 

This is a work-in-progress library for DCS A-10C performance calculations.

## Takeoff Performance

- PTFS: Predicted Fan Speed
- Takeoff index (Max thrust and 3% below PTFS)
- Takeoff speed (Flaps 7 config only )
- Rotation speed ( Flaps 7 config only )
- Takeoff Ground run (distance)  with wind correction (Flaps 7, Flaps 0)
- Critical Field Length (CFL) with wind correction (Flaps 7, Flaps 0)
- 50 feet obstacle clearance distance Max thrust (Flaps 7, Flaps 0)
- Takeoff speed (Flaps 0)

- RCR values and conversion without antiskid

## TODO

- 50 feet obstacle clearance distance 3% below PTFS (Flaps 7, Flaps 0)


## Utils

- QNH Conversions
- PressureAltitude calculation
